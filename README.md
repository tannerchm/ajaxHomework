# Giphy AJAX App

I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of my favorite movies. I call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.



1. **Hit the GIPHY API**.

2. **The app takes the topics in this array and create buttons in HTML.**

3. **When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.**

4. **When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.**
